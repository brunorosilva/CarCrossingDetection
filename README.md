# Car Crossing Detection

This is my graduate work for the Specialization in AI at the Escola Polit√©cnica da USP (Poli-USP).

This work consists in a detection algorithm for vehicle street corner crossings using camera data.

This work will be made using Python 3.7, due to usage of several tools (such as dataclasses) and the libraries OpenCV, numpy, tensorflow and poetry (package management). For the deployment, Docker container will be used in the GCP Docker registry and will be acessible by a Flask application.
